# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Ceaser Cipher algorithm.<br>
Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.<br>

# The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example:

With a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
With a shift of -1, 'B' would become 'A', 'C' would become 'B', and so on.


Run the Program in the Terminal or VS Code.


# Once the program is running, you will see a menu with options:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption:
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit

## Encrypt a Message
   - Choose option 1 from the menu.
   - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (an integer representing how many positions each letter in the message should be shifted).
   - The program will output the encrypted message.

## Decrypt a Message
   - Choose option 2 from the menu.
   - Enter the message you want to decrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (the same value used to encrypt the message).
   - The program will output the decrypted message.

## Exit
   - Choose option 3 from the menu to exit the program.



# Example:


## Encrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1

Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!

Enter the shift value: 3

Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!



## Decrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2

Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!

Enter the shift value: 3

Decrypted Message: Hello, World!



## Exiting the Program:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 3

Exiting the program.
