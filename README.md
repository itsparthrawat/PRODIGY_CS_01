# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Ceaser Cipher algorithm.<br>
Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.<br>

## The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example:

With a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
With a shift of -1, 'B' would become 'A', 'C' would become 'B', and so on.


Run the Program in the Terminal or VS Code.

# How to Run

Open VS Code.

Click on File -> New File or press Ctrl+N.

Save the new file with a .py extension, for example, caesar_cipher.py.

Copy the provided Caesar Cipher code into your new Python file.

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code by clicking on View -> Terminal or by pressing `Ctrl+`` (backtick).

Ensure you're in the directory where your caesar_cipher.py file is saved. You can navigate to the correct directory using the cd command. For example: cd path\to\your\directory

Run the program by typing the following command in the terminal: python caesar_cipher.py

If you are using Python 3, you might need to use: python3 caesar_cipher.py

## Interact with the Program

Once the program is running, you can interact with it by following the on-screen prompts:

Enter encrypt to encrypt a message or decrypt to decrypt a message.

Provide the message and the shift value as requested.

The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message based on your input.


## Once the program is running, you will see a menu with options:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption:
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit

## Encrypt a Message
   - Choose option 1 from the menu.
   - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (an integer representing how many positions each letter in the message should be shifted).
   - The program will output the encrypted message.

## Decrypt a Message
   - Choose option 2 from the menu.
   - Enter the message you want to decrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (the same value used to encrypt the message).
   - The program will output the decrypted message.

## Exit
   - Choose option 3 from the menu to exit the program.



# Example:


## Encrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1

Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!

Enter the shift value: 3

Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!



## Decrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2

Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!

Enter the shift value: 3

Decrypted Message: Hello, World!



## Exiting the Program:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 3

Exiting the program.
