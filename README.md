# PRODIGY_CS_01
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Ceaser Cipher algorithm.<br>
Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.<br>


Run the Program in the Terminal or VS Code.


# Once the program is running, you will see a menu with options:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption:
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit


**By inserting 1 you can Encrypting a Message.**

**By inserting 2 you can Decrypting a Message.**

**By inserting 3 you can Exit the Program.**



# Example:


## Encrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1

Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!

Enter the shift value: 3

Encrypted Message: Khoor, Zruog!



## Decrypting a Message:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2

Enter the message to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!

Enter the shift value: 3

Decrypted Message: Hello, World!



## Exiting the Program:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
3. Exit

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 3

Exiting the program.
